## Analysis of Citibike Data

### 1. Map 
#### First I took a look at the map of all the the citibike stations in New Jersey.  This shows the the most popular start locations on a variable color scale with the more popular stations in darker green and the less popular in in lighter green.  
#### What this shows is that the concetration of stations is focused in the zipcode 07302 with the most popular station being in the center of that zipcode.  This seems to be the job center and witht the outlying stations more spread out and having less trips.
#### The most popular stations did not seem to change much with over the months or years measured.

### 2. Demographics
#### In this dashboard we explored some of the demographic information for the subscriber base and found an uneven distribution in both gender and age.
#### In terms of age the most popular age group seems to be young communters in the age 30 to 40 whicg makes up the vast majority of all rides.  
#### In terms of gebder there is also almost a three-one ratio in male to female trips, which is persistent accross all age groups.
#### Promotions to encourage females and young and older riders should be broad and accross all all stations as the data showed that alhtough there is some minor changes in the ratios of ages and gender based on the Start station, it seems mostly consistent across all start locations.

### 3. Coronavirus Impact
##### To show the impacts of the coronavirus I chose the 2019 and 2020 time range.  This showed a large impact from the virus especially during the early lock down months of April and May which showed sharp declines in the number of trips.  Although trips did make a recovery they did not reach the 2019 levels for any month
#### An unepected outcome was the shift in peak rider time based on time of day.  The 2019 trips showed large peak times from 7am-9However during am with a drop off then followed with large peak times from 5pm-7pm.  This suggests a large commuter ridership.
#### However, during 2020 and the pandemic ridership time of day changed with a much lower peak in the morning and a gradual ramp up to the 5pm-7pm time.  This may suggest the ridership was working from home or would start thier work day later and then perhaps do errands or retrieve food at the end of the day.
